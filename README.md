 ## Witch one of two versions of Ping_rep should I use?
  The best is the one without gui(no_gui), the one with GUI is still under development and I am trying to finish it.

## How to run the program
 First you should install it from the green button above. After you should click on the folder that says no_gui or gui(still not working) depents on what you want. After that you should double click on the file ```main.exe```. And that's it.
